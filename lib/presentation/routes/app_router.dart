/// This class defines all the navigation routes and their corresponding screens

/// The router is configured with:
/// - Initial location set to the splash screen
/// - Route definitions with paths, names, and screen builders
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// MaterialApp.router(
///   routerConfig: AppRouter.router,
/// )
/// ```
